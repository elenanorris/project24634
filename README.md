# Project 2

Elijah Kenning and Elena Norris
COP4634 - Systems and Networks 1


This project Computes the Collatz sequences for integers using:

-single thread
-multi-thread with no lock
-multi-thread with lock

 and compares the runtime outcome between them. The no lock option allows for seeing race conditions and how they can effect the performance of the program.
 The threads computes the Collatz sequence for each number.
 The length of time each computation takes is stored in the vector histogramArray
 Runs using make

Makefile - contains executable
mt-collatz.cpp - main code that performs the Collatz computations
Report - contains information about the project
Excel file - contains the run information
